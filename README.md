# MMMack MMMeller's Delicious Scrabble Solver

Mack Meller posted [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wv6hfLwdhts&lc=UgwHdcMLn12B8VBTUdF4AaABAg.9xxtwBC7Y579xzv_vpfyVU) about a Scrabble variant using 30 Ms and a 9x9 board, and stated in the comments that he'd love to see a solver for it. This is my attempt at that solver, in Rust.
